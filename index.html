            <p id="1"><strong>Nature</strong>
                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of
                the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part
                of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate
                category from other natural phenomena.<sup>[1]</sup>

            <p id="2">The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,
                or
                "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". <sup>[2]</sup>
                In ancient
                philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
                originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world
                to develop of their own accord. <sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup> The concept of nature as a whole, the
                physical universe, is one of
                several expansions of the original notion; <sup>[1]</sup> it began with certain core applications of the
                word φύσις
                by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus),
                and has steadily gained currency ever since.

                During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
                reality, organized and moved by divine laws. <sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup> With the Industrial
                revolution, nature increasingly
                became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as
                sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence
                or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got
                reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. <sup>[1]</sup>

                Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can
                refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated
                with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord,
                such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or
                wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially
                altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.
